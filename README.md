The team's task is to build a video games that would utilize the device called "Leap Motion". The Leap Motion device utilizes 
infrared (IR) sensors which tracks hand and finger movements as an input parameter, translating them to tracking data, which can 
then be analyzed and used to replicate actions within  a system.  This style of tracking requires no direct contact between the 
userâ€™s hands and hardware, or controller devices, for the user to interact with the system.

The purpose of this project is to follow the recreational route of the leap motion device with a variety of games, to include:

1)	Outbreak Omega - A first-person shooter game, set during the start of a zombie outbreak in a prison.

2)	Nimbus-Rider - A scrolling, coin and gem collecting game set in the sky with obstacles to try to prevent 
                   the player from collecting too many coins.

3)	LEAP BASS- A musical game, like Guitar Hero and Dance, Dance Revolution, which allows a player to use hand movements 
               to match the directional beat of the song.
